## 2. Strategic Contexts

This section serves as a strategic reference for capabilities, assets, and operational protocols.

### 2.1. Personal Context ("Who Am I?")
> This section is a collection of current public-facing bios and internal guiding prompts. It serves as a "single source of truth" for defining personal brand and operational preferences.

#### 2.1.1. LinkedIn Headline (Public-Facing Identity)
AI Implementation Strategist | Harvard Certified in Artificial Intelligence | Driving Business Transformation Through Results-Oriented Human-AI Collaboration | Remote-First

#### 2.1.2. LinkedIn About (Public-Facing Narrative)
*(Source: User Prompt &)*

Artificial Intelligence isn't just another fad; it's the fundamental reorganization of how value is created. It’s not just another tool; it’s the operating system for the future of business. Just as electricity once transformed factories into engines of progress, AI is now reshaping how solutions are developed, and how services are delivered, at a scale never before possible.

We stand at the dawn of a new era.

While most will automate their existing processes, pioneers will radically reimagine what’s possible, and deploy previously inconceivable business models. Businesses that implement surface-level solutions will see incremental gains, while their foundations crumble beneath them. Only those with the courage to profoundly reinvent themselves, ahow they think, decide, and operate, will create a compounding advantage, and reign over the markets for decades to come.

The distance between these two approaches isn't merely a performance gap. It's rapidly becoming an unbridgeable chasm separating tomorrow's icons from yesterday's cautionary tales.

I didn’t come this far to automate spreadsheets.

I’m here to purposefully reinvent civilization —one implementation at a time.

I’m looking to do previously impossible things, and do them extraordinarily well.

My unique value lies at the intersection of strategic blitz execution and tactical precision:

**Business Acumen:**
25+ years of experience crafting and executing results-oriented strategies that translate complex challenges into tangible outcomes that boost the bottom line.

**Technical Foundation:**
Harvard CS50 certified and CS50AI in progress, developing expertise in state-of-the-art frameworks, strengthening my skills in Python, SQL, Data Science, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Prompt Engineering.

**Visionary Leadership:**
Proven track record in digital transformation, technology adoption, and business process optimization, delivering measurable results through cross-functional leadership.

**Human-Centered Design:**
Deep understanding that successful AI implementation isn't about replacing humans. It's about amplifying what makes us human in the first place, and creating unprecedented value through carefully-orchestrated human-AI collaboration. It’s about forging a world where AI handles the mundane, freeing us to find fulfillment in the transcendental.

History rewards those with the courage to lead when the map is still being drawn.

I possess the vision, the drive, the strategic foresight, and the technical skills to lead the charge and help 𝐲𝐨𝐮 make history!

Are 𝐲𝐨𝐮 ready?

#### 2.1.3. Upwork Profile Overview (Income Engine Pitch)

#### 2.1.4. AI Master Prompt (Internal Operating Protocol)
***Note:** User-identified as "Not very outdated. Does need some tweaking." The portfolio section is outdated (missing AI Refill, etc.) but the core preferences are correct.*

Be brief, succinct, concise, to the point.
I don't need a cheerleader.
I need cold and brutal honesty.
Don't give me answers built on assumptions.
Give me hard facts from reliable sources.
Prioritize clarity and high signal-to-noise ratio.
Don't waste my time.
I'm practical and action oriented.
Deliver responses that are direct and actionable.
I have a B.A. in Business Administration with minor in Finance, a B.A. in Economics, and a Masters in Economics.
I'm confident, forward-looking, and ambitious.
This year I completed Harvard's CS50x, CS50AI, and Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence. I continue studying Data Science and AI.
My vision is to become an international Trusted Authority in Artificial Intelligence. Help me become it as soon as possible!
My short term main goal is to use AI to make money, enough to be my primary source of income. All help towards this goal is required.
My current portfolio has 2 projects:
Carl, a RAG chatbot that emulates Carl Sagan persona, in production, public, live at: https://talktocarl.online
IngePro, a construction productivity app with AI forecasting and AI insights, in production, with paying clients, behind a paywall, live at: https://ingepro.app
My portfolio, still under construction, is live at: https://aidev.international
Help me make it a "shut up and take my money" portfolio!
I use a Mac Book Pro with Apple M1 Pro, Sequoia 15.6.
And an iPhone 13, iOS 18.6.1

    * **Status:** 1 course completed, 1 in progress.
    * **Active Course:** CS50's Introduction to Programming with R (CS50R).
    * **Current Progress:** "Lecture" module within the "Representing Data" section.

### 2.3. Workflow Context (GitHub Green: The Central Proof-of-Work)

*(Note: Both drafts are included as requested for later editing.)*

#### Draft 1 (AI-Generated Protocol)

This protocol is the tactical implementation of the strategic mandate: **"If it's not on GitHub, it didn't happen."** Its purpose is to eliminate the workflow gap between local work and public proof-of-work.

* **Core Principle:** Treat Everything as a Repository.
* **The Action Plan:**
    1.  **Initialize Immediately:** Before any other work, create the GitHub repository.
    2.  **Commit All Artifacts, Not Just Code:** Your contribution graph tracks *commits*. Planning documents, architecture notes (`README.md`), and slides are valuable work products.
    3.  **Adopt High-Frequency, Atomic Commits:** Do not wait for a feature to be "finished."
    4.  **Mandatory End-of-Day (EOD) Push:** A non-negotiable daily ritual.
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "EOD: [Brief description of progress]"
        git push
        ```
* **The Mantras (Direct & Pragmatic):**
    * If it's not on GitHub, it doesn't exist.
    * The work isn't done until it's pushed.
    * Commit is the new save.
* **Prerequisite (Confirmed 2025-11-01):**
    * Your global Git config is now correctly set to `user.name "Jorge Luis Contreras Herrera"` and your verified email. All commits are now correctly attributed to your professional identity.

#### Draft 2 (User-Provided Text)

This is the operational protocol to ensure all work contributes to the "Authority Engine." It addresses the critical gap of translating substantial project work into visible, version-controlled artifacts.

* **Core Strategy:** Treat everything as a repository from day one.
* **Core Habit:** A non-negotiable End-of-Day (EOD) push of all progress.
* **Operating Principles (The "Direct & Pragmatic" Mantras):**
    * If it's not on GitHub, it doesn't exist.
    * The work isn't done until it's pushed.
    * Commit is the new save.
* **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Initialize Repos Immediately:** Every new project, code or content, starts with a GitHub repository.
    2.  **Commit Non-Code Artifacts:** Planning documents, research notes, outlines (`.md` files), and presentation drafts are valuable commits. They are proof of work.
    3.  **High-Frequency, Atomic Commits:** Do not wait for a feature to be "finished." A single function, a configuration change, or updating a README are all valid, individual commits.
    4.  **Mandatory EOD Push:** Before finishing work daily, run `git add .`, `git commit -m "EOD progress on [task]"`, and `git push` for every active project.
